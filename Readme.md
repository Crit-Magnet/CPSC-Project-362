For college students who need a simple chat application, the ChatterBox is a chat tool that is integrated with college campuses LMS, such as
Canvas, and allows easy conversations with all students. Unlike other products, our product makes it easy to connect and chat with other
students in private and group messages.

- **Notifications:** The application must be notified of new messages (and be able to turn off in settings).
- **Image/file sharing:** The application must be able to share images and attach files to messages.

### Non-functional Requirements

## Use Cases

- For image and file sharing, users can click a button to browse the type of file they want to share such as an image or a file. Once they choose the type of file users will be able to browse the specific folder, choose the image or file, and click on the send button to deliver the folder.
